### I use Arch Linux btw

Starting December 10, 2020, all commits are signed and can be verified with [my public key](public_key.asc?raw=true).

I have a website, https://dartegnian.com, which includes a few services:

- https://dartegnian.com - Home page, has my basic info, mood calendar, and journal. Deployed on [Vercel's platform](https://vercel.com/).
- https://blog.dartegnian.com - A blog powered by [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) CMS. Deployed on my own Linux server.
- https://notes.dartegnian.com - My [Trilium](https://github.com/zadam/trilium) instance. Deployed on my Linux server. [Read here](https://notes.dartegnian.com/share/about).
- https://portfolio.dartegnian.com - My portfolio, built with Angular. Also deployed via Vercel.
- https://projects.dartegnian.com - Kanban board, powered by [Taiga](https://www.taiga.io/). Also deployed on my Linux server.
- https://wg.dartegnian.com - A [WireGuard VPN instance](https://hub.docker.com/r/dartegnian/wg-easy-m3). On my Linux server.

I'm currently working on other projects and utilities that I can self-host, deploy, or service from my domain.
