### I use Arch Linux btw

Starting December 10, 2020, all commits are signed and can be verified with [my public key](public_key.asc?raw=true).

I have a domain hosted via Route 53, https://dartegnian.com, which includes a few services:

- [**Site**](https://dartegnian.com) - Home page, has my basic info, mood calendar, and journal. Deployed on [Vercel's platform](https://vercel.com/), built with Angular.
- [**Blog**](https://blog.dartegnian.com) - A blog powered by [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) CMS. Deployed on my own Linux server.
- [**Notes**](https://notes.dartegnian.com) - My [Trilium](https://github.com/zadam/trilium) instance. Deployed on my Linux server. [Read here](https://notes.dartegnian.com/share/about).
- [**Portfolio**](https://portfolio.dartegnian.com) - My [(open-source)](https://github.com/Dartegnian/portfolio) portfolio, built with Angular. Also deployed via Vercel.
- [**VPN**](https://wg.dartegnian.com) - A [dockerized WireGuard VPN instance](https://hub.docker.com/r/dartegnian/wg-easy-m3). On my Linux server.
- [**Web Stories**](https://stories.dartegnian.com) - AMP Web Stories showcasing moments from my life. Built with Next.js, deployed on Vercel.

I'm currently working on other projects and utilities that I can self-host, deploy, or service from my domain.
