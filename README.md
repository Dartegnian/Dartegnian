### I use Arch Linux btw

Starting from [last Thursday](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Last_Thursdayism) ([December 10, 2020](https://www.calculator.net/day-of-the-week-calculator.html?today=12%2F10%2F2020&x=107&y=27)), all commits are signed and can be verified with [this public key](public_key.asc). Save it, it's all yours my friend ðŸ™‚
This is my personal PGP key, used for commits, messages, verification, etc. My [key from 2018](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x62bc11ceb5b6f881) is voided.

I have my own website, https://dartegnian.com, which includes a few services:

- https://dartegnian.com - My home page, features basic information about me. Deployed on [Vercel's platform](https://vercel.com/).
- https://blog.dartegnian.com - My new blog powered by [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) CMS. Deployed on my own Linux server.
- https://notes.dartegnian.com - My [Trilium](https://github.com/zadam/trilium) instance. Deployed on my Linux server. [Read here](https://notes.dartegnian.com/share/about).
- https://portfolio.dartegnian.com - My portfolio, built with Angular. Also deployed via Vercel.
- https://projects.dartegnian.com - Kanban board, powered by [Taiga](https://www.taiga.io/). Also deployed on my Linux server.
- https://wg.dartegnian.com - Forever One: my WireGuard VPN instance that links my devices to *one* VPN network on my VPN server.

At the moment, I'm currently working on other projects and utilities that I can self-host, deploy, or service from my domain.
