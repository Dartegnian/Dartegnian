### I use Arch Linux btw

Starting from [last Thursday](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Last_Thursdayism) ([December 10, 2020](https://www.calculator.net/day-of-the-week-calculator.html?today=12%2F10%2F2020&x=107&y=27)), all commits are signed and can be verified with [this public key](public_key.asc). Save it, it's all yours my friend ðŸ™‚


This is my personal PGP key, used for commits, messages, verification, etc. My [key from 2018](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x62bc11ceb5b6f881) is voided.

I have my own website, https://dartegnian.com, which includes a few services.
- https://dartegnian.com - Home page, a blog hosted from a 3rd party service.
  - (Will migrate to my other blog and this shall just be a landing page soon)
- https://projects.dartegnian.com - Kanban board, powered by [Taiga](https://www.taiga.io/).
- https://wg.dartegnian.com - My WireGuard VPN instance.
- https://blog.dartegnian.com - My new blog powered by [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) CMS.

At the moment, I'm currently working on other projects and utilities that I can self-host.
