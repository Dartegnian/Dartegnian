Starting from [last Thursday](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Last_Thursdayism) ([December 10, 2020](https://www.calculator.net/day-of-the-week-calculator.html?today=12%2F10%2F2020&x=107&y=27)), all commits are signed and can be verified with [this public key](public_key.asc).
This is my personal PGP key, used for commits, messages, verification, etc. My [key from 2018](http://keys.gnupg.net/pks/lookup?op=vindex&fingerprint=on&search=0xC4E268C38CA3181B) is voided.
